# Geeqie Readme for translators

## Creating a new translation

If you wish to contribute a new language, you must first create the appropriate language file - for example `de.po` is the language file for the German language.

The file prefix is determined by your locale. You can see your locale by executing the command `locale` from a command line window.

A complete list of language locales is in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).

Regional subscripts, if required, are listed in  [https://simplelocalize.io/data/locales/](https://simplelocalize.io/data/locales/) .

You should first create a blank language file by executing, for example, `touch gv.po`.

## Updating a translation file or populating a new translation file

To update (or to populate from new) a language file from the current sources, execute for example `./update-translation.sh gv.po`.

Then edit the language file using a suitable tool.

When complete, you should create a pull request on [https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/pulls](https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie/pulls).

## Which translation tool to use

The program `poedit` is one of the programs suitable for making translations.

## Required program files

`xgettext` and `itstool` are required.

## Other files

The script `gen_translations_stats.sh` generates statistics about translations.
